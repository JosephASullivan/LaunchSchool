Ben's code declares the `limit` variable outside of the method definition
and doesn't pass it in as an argument, so the method can't access it.

limit = 15

def fib(first_num, second_num)
  while first_num + second_num < limit
    sum = first_num + second_num
    first_num = second_num
    second_num = sum
  end
  sum
end

result = fib(0, 1)
puts "result is #{result}"

    second_num = sum
  end
  sum
